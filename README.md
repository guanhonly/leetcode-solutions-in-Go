# leetcode-solutions-in-Go

As Golang is more widely used, learning Golang is more necessary for a software engineer, or, just a programmer.  
As a very beginner of Golang, I think the most efficient way to learn it is to practice more and more, therefore I choose to practice Golang coding on [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/).  
This repo will be filled with my solutions for leetcode questions in pure Go, not in the order of the question IDs, but in the question categories. Since Golang is not as convient as C++ or Java, some solutions for the questions which needs specific struct(such as Stack, Queue) may be redundant due to the lack of related struct in Go's official library.  
The basic syntax of Go can be viewed in following links:
